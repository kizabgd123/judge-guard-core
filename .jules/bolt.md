## 2026-04-05 - [Synchronous Disk I/O in MobileBridge]
**Learning:** Even small JSON writes (~1KB) to `app_config.json` can introduce spikes in latency during the critical path of `JudgeGuard.verify_action`. On some systems, synchronous disk I/O can take 10-50ms, which is significant when the target is sub-10ms for cached hits.
**Action:** Offload `MobileBridge.sync_state` to a single-worker `ThreadPoolExecutor`. Use a state snapshot (`copy()`) before serialization to prevent race conditions.
